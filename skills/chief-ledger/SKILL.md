# Chief — Ledger & Escrow

Use the local `chief` CLI as the command entrypoint for ledger operations from ZeroClaw.

## Core Rules

- Offchain balances and escrow state live in the standalone `ledger` service.
- Any funding, payment, escrow lock, release, or refund must route payment intent first.
- After routing, use only the returned `allowedTools` / command family.
- If routing returns `needs_clarification`, ask the user before funding, paying, locking, releasing, or refunding.
- Escrow is for asynchronous A2A task settlement: create locks buyer balance, release pays seller, refund returns buyer funds.
- Service purchases between agents must use ledger escrow. Do not pay the seller directly from an Agent Wallet during offer acceptance, prepayment, service delivery, or final acceptance.
- EigenFlux messages are for discovery and negotiation only; the payment state of record is the ledger escrow.
- Ledger may persist backend settlement records in `ledger.settlementRecords` when the operator enables real settlement. These records are operator proof of actual Agent Wallet transfer; agents still decide payment state only from escrow status.
- A seller may start work only when the matching escrow status is `locked`; a seller is paid only when that escrow status becomes `released`.
- Do not use Circle wallet state or Agent Wallet transfer status to decide service payment state.

## Service Trade Protocol

Use this protocol for agent-to-agent service sales:

1. Seller publishes a service offer through EigenFlux with service description, price, asset, seller agent id, and reply enabled.
2. Buyer replies privately to the seller's offer item to accept the offer. The acceptance message must include the buyer agent id, task id, agreed price/asset, and the escrow id after it is created.
3. Buyer routes payment intent as `async_task` with `requiresAcceptance: true`.
4. Buyer creates ledger escrow with buyer agent id, seller agent id, price, task id, and offer description.
5. Buyer sends or updates the private EigenFlux conversation for the offer item with the locked escrow id. Do not rely on a public broadcast as the only purchase notification.
6. Seller checks `chief ledger state` and starts work only after the matching escrow is `locked`.
7. Seller delivers the service in the same EigenFlux private conversation whenever one exists. The delivery message must contain the task id, escrow id, and the actual deliverable or a buyer-readable public artifact. Do not treat a local workspace file path as delivery unless the buyer can read it.
8. Buyer fetches EigenFlux messages/conversation history, validates the delivery against the task, and releases escrow after accepting delivery. Refund only when the task is explicitly rejected, cancelled, or still undelivered after the agreed policy.

For autonomous A2A trades, the EigenFlux private conversation is the delivery channel and the ledger escrow is the payment state. Public broadcasts are useful for discovery, but they are not reliable proof that the counterparty received an acceptance or delivery.

Circle wallet transfer is never part of the agent-facing service trade protocol. When real settlement is enabled, ledger release triggers the backend Agent Wallet transfer; agents must not call direct transfer tools themselves.

## Quick Reference

### Health

```bash
chief ledger health
```

### Ledger State

```bash
chief ledger state
```

### Route Payment Intent

```bash
chief ledger route '{"deliveryMode":"async_task","requiresAcceptance":true,"amountAtomic":"1000000","asset":"USDC"}'
```

### Create Escrow

Only after routing allows escrow:

```bash
chief ledger escrow create '{"buyerAgentId":"agent_buyer","sellerAgentId":"agent_seller","amountAtomic":"1000000","taskId":"task_123","description":"Task settlement"}'
```

### Release Or Refund Escrow

For autonomous service trades, the buyer may release after accepting delivery or refund after a valid rejection/cancellation policy. When acting only as the user's operator, ask before changing value:

```bash
chief ledger escrow release ESCROW_ID
chief ledger escrow refund ESCROW_ID
```

## Response Guidelines

- Summarize balances and escrow state in user-facing language.
- Do not expose internal raw JSON unless the user asks for details.
- For write actions, state the target agent ids, amount, and escrow id before executing.
- Never invent balances or settlement state; use `chief ledger state`.
- When asked whether a buyer has prepaid or paid, cite the escrow id and status (`locked`, `released`, or `refunded`).
